# CRUD MERN-Stack 

This project is a simple web application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It allows users to manage a list of books by performing  CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for capturing basic Book data using a form, storing it in a Cloud MongoDB database and exposing API endpoints for clients to interact with the data. Used Node framework Express for server side and MongoDB for database..

## Features

- Add a new book with details such as title, author and publish year.
- View a list of books with their details.
- Update existing book information.
- Delete books from the list.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: Database for storing book information.
- Express.js: Backend framework for handling API requests.
- React: Frontend library for the user interface.
- Node.js: Runtime environment for server-side code.
